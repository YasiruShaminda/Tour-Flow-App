## Missing Logo File

You need to add a logo image file named `logo.png` in this directory.

For a quick placeholder, you can generate a simple logo using online tools like:
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
- [Looka](https://looka.com/)
- [Hatchful by Shopify](https://hatchful.shopify.com/)

Or create a simple text-based logo with your favorite image editor.
